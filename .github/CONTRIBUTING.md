# Contributing to CHIME-2

This project welcomes contributions, and input, from developers of all skill levels.

## Project Structure

The project can be broken down into three main areas:

- Web Application `/web`

  The web application serves as the view for engaging the the Penn Medicine developed models over the internet.
  
- Python Package `/chime2`

  This is a pip installable Python package which allows for easy interaction with the model.
  
- API `/api`

  This is a REST API which enables interaction with the chime2 package over the web, as well as decoupling the web application from the model.
  
You can find more information about the different project aspects in their respective README files.

## Filing Issues

Some starter templates have been provided for submitting bug reports and enhancement requests. Reading through the comments in the templates should help you to submit a clear and concise issue ticket.

## Contributing Code

Currently basic testing testing of commits is done using Travis CI, before opening a pull request please ensure that all tests pass.


This contribution guide serves as a basic primer to contributing to the codebase and is a work in progress.
